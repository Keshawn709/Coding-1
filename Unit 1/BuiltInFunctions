#built in functions = code instructions that are built-in
# to the programming language.
#usually locked away behind a keyword

#print is a built in function that lets us printout data
#in the terminal

# input() is a built in function that allows us to
# type in (put in) data through the terminal. to use
# input it must be ASSIGNED to the variable

# Data-casting Built in Functions (Data Conversion)
# Data-casting are functions that allow us to change data types

#str() - this built in function will change whatever is in the round brackets
#into a string.

number = 100
print(type(number)) # class int = integer
print(type(str(number)))# class str = string

#int() - this built in function will change whatever that is in the round brackets into
# a integer (whole number)

number = "100"
print(type(number)) # class str = string
print(type(str(number)))# class int = integer

#float() it's just a decimal. ex - 10 would turn into 10.0
# change whatever is in the round brackets into a decimal.

#bool(l) - this will change whatever is in the round brackets into a boolean (true/false) value.

number = 100
print(type(number)) # class int = integer
print(type(bool(number))) # class int = integer --> True

answer = input("please type in a number") #input ALWAYS takes in data as string

#print(4 * int(answer))
